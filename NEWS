New changes in forestChange V0.4:

Changes in function "GFCurls": A friendly message is printed if there
is no internet connection. Besides, routines for processing URLs were
changed implementing the functions "read_html" (package "curl"), and
"html_nodes" and "html_attr" (package "rvest"). Finally, This function
uses now the system of the machine ("Windows", "Linux") to change the
